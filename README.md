## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Design: Object-Oriented Principles

The backend is architected using key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure the system is scalable, modular, and maintainable.

* **Encapsulation:** Core entities like `User`, `Message`, and `ChatRoom` are modeled as classes, encapsulating their data (properties) and behavior (methods) to protect their internal state and maintain a clear API.
* **Inheritance:** A base `Message` class is extended by specialized classes like `TextMessage` and `FileMessage`, promoting code reuse and a logical class hierarchy.
* **Polymorphism:** The application can process various message types through a common interface, allowing for flexible and extensible handling of different kinds of chat content.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (LTS version) installed
* npm (comes with Node.js)
* A MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/pixelchat.git](https://github.com/your-username/pixelchat.git)
    cd pixelchat
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install backend dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in the /server directory and add your variables
    # MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    # JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

    # Start the backend server
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    # Open a new terminal and navigate to the project's root directory
    cd ..

    # Install frontend dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the frontend development server
    npm run dev
    ```

Your application should now be running, with the frontend available at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.
