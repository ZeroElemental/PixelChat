# PixelChat

Modern chat application with React + Vite (frontend) and Express + Socket.IO (backend).

## Local development

1. Frontend env: create `.env` in project root

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

2. Backend env: create `server/.env`

```
PORT=5000
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=change-me
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

3. Install and run

```
npm install
npm --prefix server install
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)

- Set Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` ‚Üí https://your-backend.onrender.com
- Deploy. `vercel.json` routes SPA to `index.html`.

### Backend (Render)

- Create a Web Service from `server/`
- Use Node version 22 (or LTS compatible)
- Build command: `npm install`
- Start command: `node src/server.js`
- Environment Variables:
  - `PORT` ‚Üí Render provides a port, but we default to 10000 in `render.yaml` (Render sets PORT at runtime; our server respects `process.env.PORT`).
  - `CLIENT_ORIGIN` ‚Üí https://your-frontend.vercel.app
  - `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CLOUDINARY_*` as required

## Notes

- The client and Socket.IO use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for API and socket connection.
- The server allows CORS for `CLIENT_ORIGIN`. In dev it also allows localhost:5173/5174.
- Real-time events: client joins a room named by the user‚Äôs ID on connect.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Secure User Authentication:** Full user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure, session-based authentication.
* **Real-Time One-on-One & Group Chats:** Instant messaging in both private and group chat rooms, powered by a robust WebSocket implementation with Socket.IO.
* **User Presence Indicators:** See which users are currently "online" or "offline" and get real-time "is typing..." feedback during conversations.
* **File & Image Sharing:** Seamlessly upload and share images and documents within any chat, with files stored securely in the cloud.
* **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** A robust security model ensuring that only the sender and intended recipients can read message contents.
* **User Profiles & Settings:** A dedicated page for users to view and update their profile information, including their username and avatar.
* **Modern UI:** A sleek and responsive user interface built with **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and styled with **Shadcn UI** & **Tailwind CSS**.
* **Scalable Backend:** A powerful backend built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript** for type safety and maintainability.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Design: Object-Oriented Principles

The backend is architected using key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure the system is scalable, modular, and maintainable.

* **Encapsulation:** Core entities like `User`, `Message`, and `ChatRoom` are modeled as classes, encapsulating their data (properties) and behavior (methods) to protect their internal state and maintain a clear API.
* **Inheritance:** A base `Message` class is extended by specialized classes like `TextMessage` and `FileMessage`, promoting code reuse and a logical class hierarchy.
* **Polymorphism:** The application can process various message types through a common interface, allowing for flexible and extensible handling of different kinds of chat content.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
* Node.js (LTS version) installed
* npm (comes with Node.js)
* A MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/pixelchat.git](https://github.com/your-username/pixelchat.git)
    cd pixelchat
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install backend dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in the /server directory and add your variables
    # MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    # JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

    # Start the backend server
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    # Open a new terminal and navigate to the project's root directory
    cd ..

    # Install frontend dependencies
    npm install

    # Start the frontend development server
    npm run dev
    ```

Your application should now be running, with the frontend available at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:5000`.
