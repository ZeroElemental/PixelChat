Link-Up: Real-Time Chat Application
(Replace the URL above with a screenshot of your application)

Link-Up is a modern, full-stack, real-time chat application built with React, TypeScript, and Node.js. It features a clean, responsive UI inspired by platforms like Discord and WhatsApp, and it's designed to be a robust foundation for a feature-rich communication platform.

‚ú® Key Features
User Authentication: Secure user registration and login using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Real-Time Messaging: Instant one-on-one messaging powered by WebSockets (Socket.IO).

User Discovery: View a list of all registered users to initiate conversations.

Modern UI: A sleek and responsive user interface built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and styled with Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS.

Scalable Backend: A powerful backend built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript for type safety and maintainability.

üíª Tech Stack

üèõÔ∏è Project Vision: Object-Oriented Design
While the current implementation uses a functional approach, the backend is designed with a clear vision to be refactored using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to enhance scalability and maintainability.

Encapsulation: Core entities like User, Message, and ChatRoom will be modeled as classes, encapsulating their data (properties) and behavior (methods) to protect their internal state.

Inheritance: A base Message class could be extended by specialized classes like TextMessage, ImageMessage, or FileMessage, promoting code reuse.

Polymorphism: A ChatRoom could handle an array of Message objects, calling a common render() method on each one, with each message type rendering itself differently.

üöÄ Future Features (Roadmap)
This project is the foundation for a much larger application. The following features are planned for future development:

User Presence Indicators: Real-time "online," "offline," and "is typing..." indicators.

Group Chats: Functionality to create and manage chat rooms with multiple participants.

File & Image Sharing: The ability to upload and share images, documents, and other files within chats, integrating with a cloud storage service like AWS S3.

Notifications: Real-time push notifications for new messages when the application is in the background.

End-to-End Encryption (E2EE): A challenging but highly valuable security feature to ensure that only the sender and intended recipients can read messages.

User Profile & Settings: A dedicated page for users to update their profile information, such as their username and avatar.

‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version) installed

npm (comes with Node.js)

A MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pixelchat.git
cd pixelchat
Set up the Backend:

Bash

# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install backend dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file in the /server directory and add your variables
# MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
# JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Start the backend server
npm run dev
Set up the Frontend:

Bash

# Open a new terminal and navigate to the project's root directory
cd ..

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm run dev
Your application should now be running, with the frontend available at http://localhost:5173 and the backend at http://localhost:5000.
